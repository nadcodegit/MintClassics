Analyze Data in a Model Car Database with MySQL Workbench
Mint Classics Company, a retailer of classic model cars and other vehicles, is looking at closing one of their storage facilities. 

To support a data-based business decision, they are looking for suggestions and recommendations for reorganizing or reducing inventory, while still maintaining timely service to their customers. For example, they would like to be able to ship a product to a customer within 24 hours of the order being placed.

As a data analyst, I have been asked to use MySQL Workbench to familiarize yourself with the general business by examining the current data. I am provided with a data model and sample data tables to review. I isolated and identified those parts of the data that could be useful in deciding how to reduce inventory. I wrote queries to answer questions like these:

1) Where are items stored and if they were rearranged, could a warehouse be eliminated?

2) How are inventory numbers related to sales figures? Do the inventory counts seem appropriate for each item?

3) Are we storing items that are not moving? Are any items candidates for being dropped from the product line?

The answers to questions like those should help to formulate suggestions and recommendations for reducing inventory with the goal of closing one of the storage facilities. 

Project Objectives

1. Explore products currently in inventory.

2. Determine important factors that may influence inventory reorganization/reduction.

3. Provide analytic insights and data-driven recommendations.

Summary:
The analysis revealed that 'Warehouse d (South)' is the most suitable candidate for closure due to its low inventory levels, thus minimising redistribution costs. Moreover, the study identified various products that are either overstocked or understocked, providing an opportunity to inventory optimisation.

Recommendationas:
* Close Warehouse 'd': Given its low inventory levels, it's recommended to close warehouse 'd' to save on operational costs.
* Inventory Redistribution: Overstocked items should be reduced, especially in warehouses 'a' and 'b', to make room for the inventory from closing warehouse 'd'.
* Product Line Optimisation: The product 1985 Toyota Supra has never been ordered and should be considered for removal from the product line, freeing up more space.
* Restock Understocked Items: Items identified as 'Understocked should be restocked to meet demand.
